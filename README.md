# pay_sheet_generator

This is a Python command line program that is being used to help people working at my school easily create paysheets showing the days they work.
The main idea is that the user has a fairly consistent schedule they can enter. The program will save this schedule and attach it
to the users name. The user can login and then feed some information to the program about the current month, and any irregularites
in their working time that month, and the program will export the schedule into an excel sheet.
